# General Context
The three letters of John: 1, 2, 3 John has the similar literary style with the Gospel of John.
So, people automatically assumes that it is John who wrote these letters.

1 John is more about the "amplification" of the core ideas of the faith which revolves around the different angles and cyclical repetition of Love, Life, and Truth.

# Chapter 1
This chapter covers the `The Word of Life` and God is Light in `Walking in the Light`

## Historical Context
- In this time, John defended the faith from people arguing that Jesus was spiritual and not physical.
- John basically was saying that "we saw, we heared, we touched"
- John uses a contrast between light and dark. It's a common symbol to describe good and evil.

## Analysis
- "We" in the texts refer to John, and the disciples. "You" in the texts refer to us and the next generation.
- John stressed that Jesus Christ's incarnation is real. Not a myth nor idea but a person who came in flesh.
- When John connects Jesus to eternal life itself, eternal life is not about forever living but in relationship with the Father through Christ.
- When John invited us to a fellowship, it shows that faith in Jesus builds a community rooted in God's love. To God and to others.

## Application
- Faith in Jesus is not rooted in imagination but in real history. 
- We can testify to what Christ has done to our lives.
- When John wrote "And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete." Means that every time we tell someone or write something about how God moved in our lives, 
it shows that "this is what God can do" and it may complete someone's joy. 
- When we pursue God, we pursue light with no mixture of sin or "gray areas" where sin hides.
- Faith is not just words but by lifestyle. Claiming fellowship with God while living in sin is hypocrisy.
- Walking with God is walking with others as well. 
- Acknowledge that we sinned against God and walk with humility. Confess and don't hide. Bring it to light where grace covers it. To deny sin, is to deny truth.
