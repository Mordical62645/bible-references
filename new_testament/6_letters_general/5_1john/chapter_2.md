# Chapter 2
This chapter cover `Christ Our Advocate`, `The New Commandment`, `Do Not Love the World`, `Warning Against Antichrists`, and `Children of God`. 

## Historical Context
- Jesus as our Advocate (Greek: Parakletos = lawyer/defender)
- "Propitiation" = the atoning sacrifice that satisfies God's justice. (see Isaiah 53)
- Commandment keeping is the fruit of salvation. Not the root. (see Paul's letters.)
- Lip service without obedience = falsehood. (see John 14:15)

## Analysis
- When John wrote "My little children", it shows pastoral love. John acknowledged human weakness.
- Jesus is our Advocate before the Father. Jesus defends us by His righteousness and sacrifice.
- Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for the whole world, but effective for those who believe.
- "Know Him" is not talking about intelectually knowing Him (that would be impossible to do), but it's about relational intimacy.   
- "Perfected" means brought to maturity.

## Application
- Believers should avoid sin.
- When we fail, Jesus defends us.
- NEVER hide in shame and ALWAYS run to Christ.
- The cross is the ULTIMATUM. Everything leads back and is won on the cross. Never doubt God's forgiveness. The cross is sufficient and enough even for the deepest failures.
- This pushes us to SPREAD THE GOSPELS. The offer is for all.
- True faith shows in obedience. Obedience proves relationship. Obedience over words.
- When we say we're christians, our lives must reflect Christ.
- Obedience nurtures love.
- Assurance comes not from feelings, but from faith in Christ expressed in obedience.
- STRIVE FOR CONSISTENCY. Love matures when we walk daily in God's word.
