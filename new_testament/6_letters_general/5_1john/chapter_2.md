# Chapter 2
This chapter cover `Christ Our Advocate`, `The New Commandment`, `Do Not Love the World`, `Warning Against Antichrists`, and `Children of God`. 

## Historical Context
- Jesus as our Advocate (Greek: Parakletos = lawyer/defender)
- "Propitiation" = the atoning sacrifice that satisfies God's justice. (see Isaiah 53)

## Analysis
- When John wrote "My little children", it shows pastoral love. John acknowledged human weakness.
- Jesus is our Advocate before the Father. Jesus defends us by His righteousness and sacrifice.
- Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for the whole world, but effective for those who believe.

## Application
- Believers should avoid sin.
- When we fail, Jesus defends us.
- NEVER hide in shame and ALWAYS run to Christ.
- The cross is the ULTIMATUM. Everything leads back and is won on the cross. Never doubt God's forgiveness. The cross is sufficient and enough even for the deepest failures.
- This pushes us to SPREAD THE GOSPELS. The offer is for all.
