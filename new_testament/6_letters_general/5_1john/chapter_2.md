# Chapter 2
This chapter cover `Christ Our Advocate`, `The New Commandment`, `Do Not Love the World`, `Warning Against Antichrists`, and `Children of God`. 

## Historical Context
- Jesus as our Advocate (Greek: Parakletos = lawyer/defender)
- "Propitiation" = the atoning sacrifice that satisfies God's justice. (see Isaiah 53)
- Commandment keeping is the fruit of salvation. Not the root. (see Paul's letters.)
- Lip service without obedience = falsehood. (see John 14:15)
- Leviticus 19:18 tells us to love other as we love ourselves but this commandment remade new in Christ in John 13:34 the we ought to love others as Jesus loves us. 
- John connects belief with community love.
- John reassures different groups: children, fathers, young men.
- John urges believers to remain in what they heard from the beginning (apostolic teaching). 

## Analysis
- When John wrote "My little children", it shows pastoral love. John acknowledged human weakness.
- Jesus is our Advocate before the Father. Jesus defends us by His righteousness and sacrifice.
- Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for the whole world, but effective for those who believe.
- "Know Him" is not talking about intelectually knowing Him (that would be impossible to do), but it's about relational intimacy.   
- "Perfected" means brought to maturity.
- Love = proof of light. Hate = blindness.
- Children = assurance of forgiveness, Fathers = deep knowledge of God, Young men = strength and victory over evil.
- "World" = sinful system opposed to God (not creation or people). Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.
- The Holy Spirit guides and protects us from deception.
- Abiding prepares us in Christ's return.

## Application
- Believers should avoid sin.
- When we fail, Jesus defends us.
- NEVER hide in shame and ALWAYS run to Christ.
- The cross is the ULTIMATUM. Everything leads back and is won on the cross. Never doubt God's forgiveness. The cross is sufficient and enough even for the deepest failures.
- This pushes us to SPREAD THE GOSPELS. The offer is for all.
- True faith shows in obedience. Obedience proves relationship. Obedience over words.
- When we say we're christians, our lives must reflect Christ.
- Obedience nurtures love.
- Assurance comes not from feelings, but from faith in Christ expressed in obedience.
- STRIVE FOR CONSISTENCY. Love matures when we walk daily in God's word.
- To "abide" in Christ means to stay, remain, "bumabad", or soaked in deep union. To "abide" we must walk as He did - humility, love, obedience, sacrifice.
- "Does my life look like Jesus' life?". Christ is the pattern.
- Every relationship is a test of love. Walk in light by choosing love.
- Grudges, bitterness, envy keeps us in spiritual darkness (blindness).
- Don't compare maturity in faith, but embrace growth.
- Align desires with eternity.
- Denying Jesus = denying the Father. Guard your faith.
- Stay rooted in the Scripture. Don't chase trends; stay with the Gospel Truth.
- Practicing righteousness proves new birth.
- Live today as if Christ will return tonight.
