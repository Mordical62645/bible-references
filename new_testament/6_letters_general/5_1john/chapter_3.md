# Chapter 3
This chapter covers the rest of `Children of God`, and `Love One Another`.

## Historical Context
- In Roman society, to be adopted into a family was a huge honor and John stresses that being called God's children is the highest honor.
- Early christian lived under persecution and uncertainty so John gives hope about future transformation.
- "Lawlessness" (Greek: anomia) means rebellion, not just mistakes. In Jewish culture, sin = rejecting God's order.
- Early christians lived in tight communities - love was survival.

## Analysis
- God elevates us into His family. 
- Salvation came but we are still not a complete children of God until Christ returns.
- Hope in Christ motivates purity. True hope transforms behavior.
- Jesus' mission is removing sin, not tolerating it. To be free FROM sin not free TO sin.
- A lifestyle of sin shows distance from Christ.
- Sin aligns us with Satan's rebellion. Jesus came to break that bondage.
- "Seed" = God's nature implanted by the Holy Spirit.
- Love proves new life. Hate = murder in the heart.
- Jesus sets the standard: True love = sacrificial.
- God's mercy and knowledge is greater, than our hearts guilt that condemns us.
- Two commands: believe in Christ + love one another.

## Application
- Our identity is not about what other people label us but about God calling us as His children.
- Strive to be christlike. Struggles are temporary.
- If our hope is in Christ, it should show how we live - turning away from sin.
- Sin is not just "slipping up", it's opposing God's rule. Treat it seriously.
- Christ came to free us from sin. Do not excuse sin.
- Check your habits. Are you living in continual sin, or in repentance and growth?
- Don't just "know" about God, live it out. True faith produces righteousness.
- Don't flirt with sin. Live in the victory Christ won.
- If God's Spirit lives in you, there must be change.
- Identity shows in actions: righteousness and love.
- Jealousy destroys, love builds unity.
- Examine your heart. Bitterness = spiritual death. Forgiveness = spiritual life.
- Love is not feelings but sacrifice. Serve others when it costs.   
- Love is proven by action, not empty words.
- NEVER choose to wallow in guilt. Trust God's forgiveness.
- Obedience fuels prayer confidence. A clean consience stengthens faith.
- Christianity = faith in Christ + love in action, proven by the Spirit in us.
