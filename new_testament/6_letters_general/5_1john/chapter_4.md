# Chapter 4
This chapter covers `Test the Spirits` and `God is Love`

## Historical Context
- Gnostics: People who practices mystical knowledge based religious system
- Docetist: Who believes that Jesus and His early life is nothing more than just spirituel.
- John warns us to test teachings against the truth revealed in Chrsit.
- In Greco-Roman culture, many spiritual ideas circulated. Personal take: Maybe John was talking about people who practices Greek-Roman mythology such as Zeus. There is a passage in the Acts about these where Paul wast mistaken as "Hermes"
- These are the times of when Christianity is building from ground up. So christians in this period felt outnumbered and weak compared to pre-existing paganism of that time.
- "Propitiation" means Jesus bore God's wrath for sin - a radical idea in contrast to pagan sacrifices where humans sought to appease gods.
- Pagan religions used fear to control worshippers. Christianity offers confidence and love in God.


## Analysis
- Not every teaching that sounds "spiritual" is from God.
- The test of truth is Christ Himself - specifically His incarnation. Denying Jesus' real humanity undermines the gospel.
- Jesus is fully God and fully man. If someone denies either, they are not speaking from God.
- Assurance of victory - the indwelling Holy Spirit is stronger than Satan.
- Those of the world vs those of God. Receptivity to truth reveals one's spiritual state.
- Pagan gods were not associated with love, but with power and lust. 
- The Christian God is uniquely described as love itself.
- God's love is defined ny sacrifice, not sentiment.
- Fear of judgment is removed through God’s perfect love in Christ.
- Our ability to love is because God showed it to us first. 
- Love is not optional; it is the proof of faith. Hatred toward fellow believers is incompatible with love for God.

## Application
- Christians are called to practice **discernment** 
- Test every teaching by Scripture and the Spirit. We must filter everything through God's Word.
- NEVER FEAR ANYTHING BUT GOD. God's Spirit in us is greater than anything of this world.
- Don’t be surprised if worldly people reject the gospel. Listen to God’s Word, not the crowd.
- Love is the evidence of truly knowing God. 
- Our love of others proves our relationship with God. No love = no true knowledge of Him.
- True love acts. If God loved us this way, we should also love sacrificially.
- Loving between believers is how the unseen God becomes visible to the world.
- The Christian life is both inward (Spirit) and outward (confession). We live it and proclaim it.
- When fear rises, remember His perfect love covers you.
- Examine your relationships. If love is absent, something is wrong in your walk with God.
